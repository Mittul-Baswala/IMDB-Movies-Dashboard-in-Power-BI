## 🧠 Strategic Insights

### 🎯 Insight #1: Genre Investment Strategy
Studios should prioritize **Action** and **Adventure** genres, which account for over 70% of total revenue. These genres consistently outperform others in both box office and audience engagement.

### 🎯 Insight #2: Marketing Focus
High IMDb ratings (7–9) are common across genres, but **blockbuster success is driven more by genre, cast, and concept** than critical acclaim. Marketing should emphasize these elements to maximize ROI.
